## y@R &trade; ~ You-At-A-Resource &trade;

Open-Source Content Creation Libraries and Tooling for our y@R &trade; app.

- Android
- iOS
- MacOS
- Windows

## Our Raison d'être ...

- Public
- Open-Source

The reason for these libraries being made public and (typically) open-source under the MIT Licence, is that by doing so we will be democratising the content creation opportunities for our soon to be released y@R &trade; App.

In short, users, whether individual content creators, or agencies and developers servicing their own end-clients, will need such facilities to access our direct backend upload endpoints (using access tokens) so that they can create and upload content that will be able to be viewed in our apps (iOS, Android, MacOS, Windows).

- _These libraries will enable individuals and agencies alike, to automate the creation and feeding of content to individual user accounts in our apps._
- Developers who choose to do so will also be able to use the libraries to create advanced tools that they can sell to end users to help them more efficiently create content to upload to our apps.
- Developers will, of course, also be able to use the libraries to swiftly create content for their own apps, when the benefits of doing so become obvious.

Once these libraries have sufficiently matured - and our apps are in Beta - we will start uploading videos that illustrate how to use these libraries.

_Stay tuned!_
