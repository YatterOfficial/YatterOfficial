- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @YatterOfficial
- We're in an alpha stage and these repos have been forked from my original repos at https://github.com/HarrisonOfTheNorth so that we can upload our alpha Nuget Packages to Nuget and also have an official project link in Nuget that does not represent my personal HarrisonOfTheNorth account
- Meanwhile, our Demo projects will continue to be served from HarrisonOfTheNorth
- The repos here at YatterOfficial represent the Nuget uploads, and our incremental improvements towards each new release
- For the time being, emails to the email addresses listed in both GitHub accounts go to me, Anthony Harrison
