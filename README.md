## Raison d'être ...

- Public
- Open-Source

The reason for these libraries being made public is that we will be making direct backend upload capacity for end-users (with their own access token) so that they can create and upload content that will be able to be viewed in our apps (iOS, Android, MacOS, Windows).

- _These libraries will enable individuals and agencies alike, to automate the creation and feeding of content to individual user accounts in our apps._
- Developers who choose to do so will also be able to use the libraries to create advanced tools that they can sell to end users to help them more efficiently create content to upload to our apps.
- Developers will, of course, also be able to use the libraries to swiftly create content for their own apps, when the benefits of doing so become obvious.

Once these libraries have sufficiently matured - and our apps are in Beta - we will start uploading videos that illustrate how to use these libraries.

_Stay tuned!_
